Description: In the context of frequency tables, an alluvial diagram represents
    each categorical variable (axis) as a column of stacked values, and each
    subset (or individual) as a spline through the corresponding value at each
    column. This package contains stat-geom pairs to construct both
    intra-variable boxes ("strata") and inter-variable flows ("alluvia").

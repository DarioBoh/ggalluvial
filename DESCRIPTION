Description: In the context of frequency tables, an alluvial diagram represents
    each categorical variable (axis) as a stacked bar plot, and each
    subset (or individual) as a spline passing through each axis at the value
    it takes there. This package contains stat/geom pairs to construct both
    intra-variable bars ("strata") and inter-variable splines ("alluvia").
    A temporal alluvial diagram represents frequencies along a single axis
    that change over time.

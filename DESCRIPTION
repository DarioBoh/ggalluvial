Description: Alluvial diagrams encompass a variety of charts that use x-splines
    (alluvia and flows), sometimes augmented with stacked bars (lodes or
    strata), to visualize incidence structures derived from several data types,
    including repeated categorical measures, evolving classifications,
    and multi-dimensional categorical data. This package contains stats and
    geoms that interpret multiple data formats compatible with this framework
    while hewing to the principles of tidy data and the grammar of graphics.
